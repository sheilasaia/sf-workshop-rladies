**nc_gages.shp** - This file represents USGS GAGES-II streamgage GPS coordinates in the North Carolina and was obtained from filtering out NC data from the larger zipfile here: https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/dsdl/gagesII_9322_point_shapefile.zip. Metadata is available at https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml.

**nc_gages.csv** - This file is the same as nc_gages.shp but is the tabular (.csv) version.

The conterm_basinid.txt, conterm_climate.txt, conterm_geology.txt, conterm_hydro.txt, conterm_topo.txt, gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx, and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx files were all obtained from the USGS GAGES-II dataset > basinchar_and_report_sept_2011 > spreadsheets-in-csv-format directory available at https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/dsdl/basinchar_and_report_sept_2011.zip. Metadata for these data are available at https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml.

**conterm_basinid.txt** - This file contains general watershed identification information. See gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx in this directory for more information on variable names.

**conterm_climate.txt** - This file contains climate data for each watershed. See gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx in this directory for more information on variable names.

**conterm_hydro.txt** - This file contains hydrology-related data for each watershed. See gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx in this directory for more information on variable names.

**conterm_geology.txt** - This file contains geology-related data for each watershed. See gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx in this directory for more information on variable names.

**conterm_topo.txt** - This file contains topography-related data for each watershed. See gagesII_sept30_2011_var_desc.xlsx and gagesII_sept30_2011_report.docx in this directory for more information on variable names.
